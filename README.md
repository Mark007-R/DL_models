# DL_models

A collection of deep learning and machine learning notebooks built using Python and popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. The projects cover a range of supervised learning tasks such as classification and regression, as well as incident root cause analysis.

## üìÅ Projects

### 1. **Iris Flower Classification**
- **File**: `Iris.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `iris.csv`
- **Description**: Uses a neural network model to classify Iris flowers into three species based on petal and sepal measurements.

### 2. **Spam SMS Text Classification**
- **File**: `Spam.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `Spam-Classification.csv`
- **Description**: NLP-based binary classification to detect spam messages using text preprocessing and deep learning.

### 3. **Sales Prediction**
- **File**: `keras_prac.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `sales.csv`
- **Description**: Predicts future sales using a regression model built with Keras.

### 4. **Incident Root Cause Analysis**
- **File**: `Incident Root Cause Analysis.ipynb`
- **Dataset**: `root_cause_analysis.csv`
- **Description**: Identifies the root cause of system incidents using binary features and classification logic.


üìå Note
Each notebook is self-contained with its own dataset and explanation. Ideal for beginners looking to explore hands-on deep learning use cases.
